## Hardware
1. **Arduino UNO.**  
   *I had one lying around, but you can find cheap ones on the internet (ex: [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801435608430.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.1e3d1802dr6kES&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa&_randl_shipto=US))*
1. **RGB light strips.**  
   *I used [these guys](https://www.ledbe.com/5vdc-individually-addressable-rgb-ws2812b-led-strips), 4 meters of them (4 strips, with the following characteristics):*  
   *WS2812B LED Strips Individually Addressable RGB Full Color DC5V 5050 SMD*
   - *Length: 1M 96LEDs White PCB*
   - *Waterproof Level: IP30*

1. **A fast charger (the ones that have USB output, because they have 5V output with at least 1.5-2A, maybe even 3A).**  
   *I used an old one I had from one of my phones, stripped it of the case, so it is as small as possible to fit in the handle.*
1. **An aluminum strip, for backing (looks nice)**  
   *I got one from Home Depot ([this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-1-2-in-x-96-in-Aluminum-Flat-Bar-with-1-8-in-Thick-802567/204273945)): width **1-1/2"** x length **96"**, thick **1/8"***
1. **A short extension cord**  
   *I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071XYQBXX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1). It is short, because I already have a socket up on the table, and I did not want to have a lot of cable laying around.*
1. **A small 110V plug.**  
   *I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092VQKBFB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1). Just for the ability to plug in the soldering iron or any other tool used on the craft table conveniently.*
1. **A wooden board**  
   *I got it from Home Depot ([this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-1-2-in-x-2-ft-x-4-ft-Medium-Density-Fiberboard-279388/202093821)),  2'x 4', 1/2" width.*
1. **Some plywood scraps for the sides.**  
   *For these I just used whatever pieces I had laying around the shop.*
